# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is my submission for the final course project in "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.
Included you will find a codebook and an R script (run_analysis.R), which does the following: 

- Downloads the dataset from web zip file provided (if it not already present in the working directory).
- Reads the test and training datasets and merges them into one dataset.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
- Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, clean dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
